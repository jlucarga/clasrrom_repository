plot(density(price))
plot(density(height))
plot(density(weight))

# The plot density grapgh has a bell shaped skewed. 

sd(height)
#the center or the mean is greater than the median because it has a right hand tail.

boxplot(height)

points(x, y)
```


```{r}

# A vector hight_vec
height
height_vec <-c(height)


# the lenght of the vector hight_vec
length(height_vec)

# length of height
len_height<-c(length(height))
len_height


# the mean for height
x_mean_height=(sum(height)/len_height)
x_mean_height


#length of price
n_price<-c(length(price))
n_price

#mean of height
x_mean_height=(sum(height)/len_height)
x_mean_height

#mean of price:
y_mean_price=(sum(price)/n_price)
y_mean_price

#Variance of height:

variance=(sum((height-x_mean_height)^2))/ (len_height)
variance

## Using the built-in formula for variance gives an slightly different result than calculating it automatically. 

var(height)

#standard deviation of height: 

(variance)^(1/2)

```


## More Manipulation:

### how many tents have a price less than or equal to $300
```{r}
weight_lbs<-c((weight)* .0022)

height_in<-c((height)*0.393701)

```
### how many tents have a price less than or equal to $300

```{r}
price_equal_less_300 <- length(price[price>=300])

price_equal_less_300


```

### how many tents have a price between $300 and $400 (including both $300 and $400 prices)

```{r}

price_btw_300_400 <- length((price[(price<=400)|(price>=300)]))
price_btw_300_400
```
 
###  whatâ€™s the name of the tent with maximum price

```{r}

tent[which.max(price)]

```
### how many tents have a price > $400 AND weight < 1500 grams


```{r}
tent[(price>400) & (weight < 1500)]

```
### calculate the 90th percentile for height and assign it to the object height_p90 (display this value)

``` {r}
height_p90 <- quantile(height, c(.90))
height_p90
quantile(height, probs = .9)

```
### calculate the 90th percentile for weight and assign it to the object weight_p90 (display this value)

```{r}
weight_p90 <- quantile(weight, c(.90))
weight_p90

```
### display the name of the tents with height > height_p90 AND weight > weight_p90

```{r}
last_10_percentile=tent[(height > height_p90) & (weight > weight_p90)]

last_10_percentile

```

intervals  | labels
---------------|--------
     (0, 1000] |  1kg
  (1000, 2000] |  2kg
  (2000, 3000] |  3kg
  (3000, 4000] |  4kg

```{r}
weight

weight_factor <- factor(weight)
weight_factor
str(weight_factor)

season_factor <- factor(season)
season_factor
str(season_factor)
is.ordered(season_factor)

```
Without any doubt 'working with factor' was the most difficult part of all the warmups. I will try to get support from GSI next lab.I even have to delete a lot of my work on this because I wasn't able to knit it.


### Coments and Reflections:

- I think remember how to make vector with different features were hard because there are many ways to create vector with specific type of data.

- I don't think anything was really easy, but it was interesting to have a link to help us make the graphs

- Again, I needed help to complete the assigment and it was basically the same friend that helped with the first warm-up. This person doesn't know almost nothing about r like me, but we had two laptos on and a lot of enthusiasm to find how to solve each question. 

- The most time consuming part was the figuering out how to do the boxplot with ** _title_, _axis_ and _points_ **

- I did not understand too much the link because averything in there is new for me, but the more time I spend reading it again and again, the more I get.

- The super most frustraiting thing was trying to rememver what covariance was. I couldn't do it because I couldn't fully understand it. we basically skipped this part, I believe, in my ** Stat 20 ** class from _last year_
