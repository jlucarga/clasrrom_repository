#I've done the work durin lab, but I had to re-do it because it was pretty messy and I didn't know I have to submitted.
##Also, I believe I had problems downloding the packages, so when press "knit" it gives an erro. I'm working on investigating how to do it right. I still find kind of difficult following the tutorials. For know, I'll make the downloding part as a comment to debug.
