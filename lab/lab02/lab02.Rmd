#typeof()  type of storage of any object

#str() displays the structure of an object in a compact way

#mode() gives the data type (as used in R)

#object.size() gives an estimate of the memory space used by an object

#length() gives the length (i.e. number of elements)

#head() take a peek at the first elements

#tail() take a peek at the last elements

#summary() shows a summary of a given object

length(player)
length(team)
length(position)
length(salary)
#Does all the objects has the same length?
#Yes, all the objects has the same length!

#Are there missing values like NA?
#No, that I can see from this four values
